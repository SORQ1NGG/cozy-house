The others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly          loved.        </div>        <div class="about-description">          We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get sick, feel comfortable (including          psychologically) and well.          We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken          by the shelter staff.          Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.        </div>      </div>    </div>  </div></template><style src="./style.scss" lang="scss" scoped/>
